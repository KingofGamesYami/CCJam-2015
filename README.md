This program is very simple, yet useful.  It generates a circular platform from glass blocks below the user specified in the first argument.

Requires a command computer and a valid username

Optionally, a radius can be entered (defaults to 2) and/or a block specified (defaults to minecraft:glass).

If it can, the program will run in 0.3 second intervals.  If the processing takes longer than 0.3 seconds, the program will run as fast as possible.

The glass generated is automatically removed when the player leaves the area, but is not removed when the program is stopped.  To avoid lots of glass in your world, I suggest standing on the ground when you terminate the program.

To go down, you can simply break the glass beneath you - it will not be replaced.  This serves two purposes: speeding up the program and allowing the user to 'fall' if need be.
